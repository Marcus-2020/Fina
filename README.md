This project is being developed during the "Jornada Fullstack 2024" from Balta.io.

The project is a personal finance control SaaS application 
with multiple users who can add categories and transactions 
and see the results in the UI.

The project is being developed using the following technologies:
- ASP.NET Core 8
- Entity Framework Core 8
- Blazor WebAssembly
- MySQL 8

The project diverges from the original course in the following aspects:
- The project is using vertical slicing architecture
- The project is using MySQL instead of SQL Server

That's it for now.
